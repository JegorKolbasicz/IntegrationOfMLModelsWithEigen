# ü§ñ ML Model Integration: scikit-learn to C++ (Eigen)

This project serves as a proof-of-concept and a foundational component for a diploma thesis, demonstrating the integration of a machine learning model trained in Python's scikit-learn with a C++ application utilizing the Eigen mathematical framework. The core idea is to leverage scikit-learn for rapid model prototyping and training, then port the trained model's logic and parameters to an efficient C++ environment for deployment or high-performance inference.

## üß† Core Concept & Features

The primary objective of this project is to bridge the gap between Python-based machine learning development and C++ application deployment. It showcases:

-   **Model Training in Python:** Demonstrates training a machine learning model (e.g., a linear regression, logistic regression, or a simple neural network) using the `scikit-learn` library.
-   **Parameter Export:** Illustrates how to extract trained model parameters (coefficients, intercepts, weights, biases) from the scikit-learn model.
-   **C++ Integration with Eigen:** Implements the model's prediction logic in C++ using the high-performance Eigen library for numerical computations (matrix operations, vector arithmetic).
-   **Data Flow:** Outlines the process of passing input data to the C++ application, performing inference with the ported model, and retrieving results.
-   **[Add Specific Model Type Here]:** (e.g., Specifically, this project implements a ported **Linear Regression model** to predict [your target variable] based on [your input features].)

## üñ•Ô∏è Technologies Used

-   **Python 3.x**:
    -   `scikit-learn`: For machine learning model training and parameter extraction.
    -   `NumPy`: Essential for numerical operations and data handling in Python.
    -   `pickle` (or `joblib`): For serializing/deserializing trained models or their parameters.
-   **C++**:
    -   **Eigen 3.x**: A high-level C++ template library for linear algebra, matrix, and vector operations, crucial for efficient numerical computations of the ported ML model.
    -   Standard C++ Libraries: For file I/O, data parsing, and general application logic.
-   **CMake** (Recommended for C++ projects): For managing the build process.

## üöÄ How to Run

### Part 1: Python - Model Training & Export

1.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install scikit-learn numpy
    ```
2.  **Train the model and export parameters:**
    Run the Python script responsible for training your model and saving its parameters in a format readable by the C++ application (e.g., plain text files, CSV, or a custom binary format if you implement parsing).
    ```bash
    python model.py
    ```
    This step will typically generate files containing the model's coefficients, intercepts, etc.

3.  **Test Python model (optional):**
    You can run `testing.py` to verify the model's predictions in Python before porting.
    ```bash
    python testing.py
    ```

### Part 2: C++ - Model Integration & Inference

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/YourProjectName.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/YourProjectName.git) # Replace with your actual repository URL
    cd YourProjectName # Navigate into the cloned directory
    ```

2.  **Ensure Eigen is available:**
    Make sure the Eigen library is accessible to your C++ compiler. You might need to install it (e.g., `sudo apt-get install libeigen3-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu or via Conan/vcpkg), or ensure its path is correctly configured in your build system.

3.  **Build the C++ application:**
    It is highly recommended to use CMake for building C++ projects that depend on external libraries like Eigen.
    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ```
    If you're not using CMake, you'd typically compile with g++ like this (adjust include paths and libraries as needed):
    ```bash
    g++ -I/path/to/eigen -o test test.cpp # Replace /path/to/eigen with your Eigen include directory
    ```

4.  **Place exported model parameters:**
    Copy the model parameters (e.g., from `model.py`'s output) into the C++ project's expected directory.
    *(e.g., "Place the `coefficients.txt` and `intercept.txt` files generated by `model.py` into the `./data/` subdirectory.")*

5.  **Run the C++ application:**
    ```bash
    ./test # Or ./your_application_name if you named it differently
    ```
    The C++ application will load the parameters, perform inference, and output results.

### üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

-   Python 3.x
-   C++ Compiler (e.g., GCC/g++)
-   Python libraries: `scikit-learn`, `NumPy`
-   C++ library: **Eigen 3.x**
-   (Optional but Recommended) `CMake` for building the C++ project.
